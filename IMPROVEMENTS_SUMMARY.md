# Inventory Service - Improvements Summary

## Overview
Your inventory service has been significantly enhanced to become a production-ready, event-driven microservice for e-commerce and stock management. The service now seamlessly integrates with other microservices through RabbitMQ event messaging.

---

## What You Had Before

### Existing Features
1. **Basic Product Management**
   - CRUD operations for products
   - Category management
   - Simple inventory tracking
   - Stock change logging
   - Low stock alerts
   - Discount management

2. **Limited Integration**
   - Basic RabbitMQ setup (not fully utilized)
   - Manual inventory updates only
   - No event consumers
   - Limited event publishing

3. **Single Warehouse Support**
   - Basic warehouse model
   - No inter-warehouse transfers
   - Limited multi-location inventory tracking

---

## What Has Been Added

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

#### **New Event Consumer System** (`src/events/eventConsumer.js`)
Automatically processes events from other services:

- **Order Events Consumer**
  - `order.placed` → Deducts inventory automatically
  - `order.cancelled` → Restores inventory
  - `order.returned` → Adds returned items back to stock
  - `order.reserved` → Handles stock reservations
  - `order.reservation.released` → Releases reserved stock

- **Purchase Events Consumer**
  - `purchase.completed` → Adds purchased inventory from suppliers
  - `purchase.received` → Updates stock when shipment arrives

**Impact**: Your inventory now updates automatically when orders are placed, cancelled, or returned by the Order Service. When Purchase Service receives goods, inventory is updated without manual intervention.

#### **Enhanced Event Publisher** (`src/events/productEvents.js`)
Publishes events to notify other services:

- `product.created` → New product added
- `product.updated` → Product information changed
- `product.deleted` → Product removed
- `inventory.updated` → Stock levels changed
- `inventory.batch.updated` → Bulk inventory updates
- `stock.reserved` → Stock held for pending order
- `stock.reservation.fulfilled` → Reservation completed
- `stock.reservation.cancelled` → Reservation released
- `stock.reservation.expired` → Reservation timed out
- `transfer.created` → New warehouse transfer
- `transfer.approved` → Transfer in progress
- `transfer.completed` → Transfer finished
- `transfer.cancelled` → Transfer cancelled

**Features**:
- Automatic retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Persistent messaging
- Structured event format with timestamps and source tracking

**Impact**: Other services (Order, Shipping, Analytics) can react to inventory changes in real-time.

---

### 2. Stock Reservation System

#### **New Model**: `StockReservation` (`src/models/StockReservation.js`)
Temporarily holds inventory for pending orders.

**Key Features**:
- Automatic expiration (configurable, default 15 minutes)
- Status tracking: active, fulfilled, cancelled, expired
- Warehouse-specific reservations
- Product variation support
- Automatic stock calculation (available = total - reserved)

#### **New Controller**: `reservationController.js`
**Endpoints**:
- `POST /v1/reservations` - Create reservation
- `GET /v1/reservations` - List all reservations
- `GET /v1/reservations/:id` - Get specific reservation
- `PATCH /v1/reservations/:id/fulfill` - Convert to sale
- `PATCH /v1/reservations/:id/cancel` - Release stock
- `GET /v1/reservations/available-stock` - Check real availability
- `POST /v1/reservations/cleanup-expired` - Clean up expired reservations

**Use Case**: When a customer adds items to cart, create a reservation. If they checkout within 15 minutes, fulfill it. If they abandon cart, reservation expires and stock becomes available again.

**Impact**: Prevents overselling, shows accurate "available" stock to customers, handles abandoned carts gracefully.

---

### 3. Warehouse Transfer System

#### **New Model**: `StockTransfer` (`src/models/StockTransfer.js`)
Manages inter-warehouse stock movements with approval workflow.

**Transfer Lifecycle**:
1. `pending` → Initial state when created
2. `in_transit` → Approved, stock deducted from source
3. `completed` → Received, stock added to destination
4. `cancelled` → Cancelled, stock restored to source

**Features**:
- Unique transfer numbers
- Approval workflow
- Tracking number support
- Multi-item transfers
- Audit trail

#### **New Controller**: `transferController.js`
**Endpoints**:
- `POST /v1/transfers` - Create transfer
- `GET /v1/transfers` - List transfers
- `GET /v1/transfers/:id` - Get transfer details
- `PATCH /v1/transfers/:id/approve` - Approve and ship
- `PATCH /v1/transfers/:id/complete` - Mark as received
- `PATCH /v1/transfers/:id/cancel` - Cancel transfer

**Workflow**:
1. **Create**: Request transfer from Warehouse A to Warehouse B
2. **Approve**: Manager approves, stock deducted from Warehouse A
3. **Ship**: Add tracking number, status changes to in_transit
4. **Complete**: Stock arrives, added to Warehouse B

**Impact**: Proper inventory tracking across multiple warehouses, prevents stock discrepancies, maintains accurate warehouse-level inventory.

---

### 4. Batch Operations System

#### **New Controller**: `batchController.js`
Perform bulk operations efficiently.

**Operations Available**:

1. **Batch Update Inventory**
   - Update stock for multiple products in one request
   - Support for increment, decrement, set operations
   - Warehouse-specific updates
   - Automatic stock change logging

2. **Batch Update Prices**
   - Update pricing for multiple products
   - Base price, sale price, cost price
   - Maintains audit trail

3. **Batch Update Status**
   - Activate/deactivate multiple products
   - Change visibility (public/private)
   - Bulk status changes

4. **Batch Delete Products**
   - Remove multiple products
   - Proper cleanup and audit

5. **Batch Import Products**
   - Import products from CSV/Excel
   - Duplicate detection
   - Partial failure handling
   - Returns success/failed/duplicate lists

**Features**:
- Transaction support for inventory updates
- Partial success handling
- Detailed result reporting
- Automatic event emission

**Impact**: Efficiently handle large datasets, import products from external sources, perform end-of-day adjustments, bulk price updates for sales.

---

### 5. Enhanced RabbitMQ Integration

#### **Updated Config**: `rabbitmq.js`
- Supports 9 queues for different event types
- Auto-reconnection on failure
- Connection health monitoring
- Graceful shutdown

**Queues**:
1. `product.events` - Product changes

3. `stock.events` - Stock movements
4. `alert.events` - Inventory alerts
5. `warehouse.events` - Warehouse operations
6. `order.events` - Order updates (consumed)
7. `purchase.events` - Purchase updates (consumed)
8. `sales.events` - Sales data
9. `transfer.events` - Transfer updates

**Impact**: Reliable event delivery, automatic recovery, better service isolation, scalable architecture.

---

### 6. Enhanced Product Controller

**Added Event Emission**:
- Product creation → Publishes `product.created`
- Product update → Publishes `product.updated`
- Product deletion → Publishes `product.deleted`
- Inventory update → Publishes `inventory.updated`

**Impact**: Other services automatically notified of inventory changes.

---

### 7. Improved Service Initialization

#### **Updated**: `src/index.js`
- Sequential startup: DB → RabbitMQ → Event Consumers → HTTP Server
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Better error logging
- Health monitoring

**Impact**: Reliable service startup, proper resource cleanup, no memory leaks.

---

### 8. Updated Routes

#### **New Routes Added**:
```
/v1/warehouses        - Warehouse management
/v1/reservations      - Stock reservations
/v1/transfers         - Warehouse transfers
/v1/batch            - Batch operations
```

**Root Endpoint Enhancement**:
`GET /inventory` now returns:
- Service status
- Version information
- List of all available endpoints

**Impact**: Better API discoverability, organized endpoints, clear service capabilities.

  eventType: 'order.placed',
  data: {
    orderId: 'ORD123',
    items: [
      { productId: 'P001', quantity: 2 }
    ]
  }
});

// Inventory Service automatically:
// 1. Receives event
// 2. Deducts stock
// 3. Updates availability status
// 4. Creates stock change record
// 5. Triggers low-stock alert if needed
```

**When Order is Cancelled:**

```javascript
// Purchase Service publishes event
publishToQueue('purchase.events', {
  eventType: 'purchase.received',
  data: {
    purchaseId: 'PUR123',
    supplierId: 'SUP001',
    items: [
      { productId: 'P001', quantity: 100 }
    ]
  }
});

// Inventory Service automatically:
// 1. Adds stock
// 2. Updates availability
// 3. Resolves low-stock alerts

// POST /v1/reservations
const reservation = await createReservation({
  productId: 'P001',
  orderId: 'pending-order-123',
  quantity: 2,
  expirationMinutes: 15
});

// After 15 minutes if not fulfilled, stock automatically released
```

## Use Case Workflows

### Use Case 1: Customer Purchase Flow

1. **Customer adds to cart**
   - Cart service calls `POST /v1/reservations`
   - Stock temporarily reserved for 15 minutes

2. **Customer checks out**
   - Order service calls `PATCH /v1/reservations/:id/fulfill`
   - Reservation becomes permanent sale
   - Order service publishes `order.placed` event
   - Inventory service deducts stock (via event consumer)

3. **Customer abandons cart**
   - Reservation expires automatically after 15 minutes
   - Stock becomes available again
   - Event published: `stock.reservation.expired`

### Use Case 2: Multi-Warehouse Operations

1. **Create transfer**
   - Warehouse manager creates transfer: NY → LA
   - `POST /v1/transfers`
   - Status: `pending`

2. **Approve and ship**
   - Manager approves transfer
   - `PATCH /v1/transfers/:id/approve`
   - Stock deducted from NY warehouse
   - Status: `in_transit`
   - Tracking number added

3. **Receive at destination**
   - LA warehouse receives shipment
   - `PATCH /v1/transfers/:id/complete`
   - Stock added to LA warehouse
   - Status: `completed`

### Use Case 3: Bulk Import from Supplier

1. **Import products**
   - `POST /v1/batch/import`
   - Upload CSV with 500 products
   - System processes all products
   - Returns: 480 success, 15 duplicates, 5 errors

2. **Update prices**
   - `POST /v1/batch/prices`
